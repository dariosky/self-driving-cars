# Machine Learning notes  
from Udacity Self Driving Cars Nanodegree  
by Dario Varotto

I collected notes and code during the CARND of Udacity, they are kept here
because verba volant, git manent.

In the notes notebook there are some notes I took about NNET, deep learning and so on.

For the projects I created a utility library **sdcnnet** that helps with common tasks for SDC.
